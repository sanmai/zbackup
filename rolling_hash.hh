// Modified Rabin-Karp rolling hash with the base of 257 and the modulo of 2^64.

// The canonical RK hash calculates the following value (e.g. for 4 bytes):

// hash = ( v1*b^3 + v2*b^2 + v3*b + v4 ) % m
//   where v1, v2, v3 and v4 are the sequence of bytes, b is the base and m
//   is the modulo.

// We add b^4 in the mix:

// hash = ( b^4 + v1*b^3 + v2*b^2 + v3*b + v4 ) % m

// This fixes collisions where sequences only differ in the amount of zero
// bytes in the beginning (those amount to zero in the canonical RK), since the
// power of b in the first member depends on the total number of bytes in the
// sequence.

// The choice of base: 257 is easy to multiply by (only two bits are set), and
// is the first prime larger than the value of any byte. It's easy to create
// collisions with the smaller primes: two-byte sequences '1, 0' and '0, base'
// would collide, for example.

// The choice of modulo: 32-bit is impractical due to birthday paradox -- you
// get a collision with the 50% probability having only 77000 hashes. With
// 64-bit, the number of hashes to have the same probability would be 5.1
// billion. With the block size of 64k, that would amount to 303 terabytes of
// data stored, which should be enough for our purposes.

// Note: ( a = ( a << 8 ) + a ) is equivalent to ( a *= 257 )
